 <h2>Dave Brubeck</h2>
 <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a webpage about our favorite artist. This took me some time to consider as I have many different artists that I enjoy.</p>
 <p>I decided to go with a musician because it is the medium of art that I engage with the most frequently.</p>
 <p>To narrow down such a broad category, I reviewed my Apple music history and determined the artist I listened to the most.</p>
 <p>That artist was the mid-twentieth century jazz pianist, Dave Brubeck and his quartet.</p>

    <a name="bio"><h2>Biography</h2></a>
    <p>Dave Brubeck was born in California in 1920. During WWII, he served as an army musician playing piano near the front line in Europe. After the war, he formed the Dave Brubeck Quartet
and went on to produce several albums during the fifties that are now considered iconic, including Time Out (1959), the first jazz album to sell a million copies. Brubeck was known for experiments
with odd time signatures and different styles and tonalities incorporated within the jazz concept.
    </p>
    <p>In 1996, Brubeck was awarded a lifetime achievement Grammy Award and in 2009, he was a Kennedy Center Honoree. Brubeck died in 2012 but his legacy lives on with the informal holiday, Dave Brubeck Day, which occurs on May 4th (5/4)
      as a hommage to Dave's most famous song, Take Five.</p>

    <a name="why"><h2>Why I listen</h2></a>
    <p>I started playing drums when I was a teenager and one of the first drum solos I heard that really caught my attention was the song Take Five, arguably the quartet's biggest hit.
       I can remember the first time I heard the song was on a Cadillac car commercial. It was very catchy and very cool to my young, impressionable ears. I remember being entranced by the 
       unusual 5/4 time signature, more common in classical than jazz or pop music.</p>
    <p>So, since I was a child, I've beening listening to the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Since then, I've discovered some of his solo work as well as his work with another jazz favorite of mine,
        vibraphonist Cal Tjader. I enjoy listening to this kind of music when I'm relaxing, cooking, driving, or doing work that requires concentration. I find instrumental music of any kind
        is ideal for this purpose.
